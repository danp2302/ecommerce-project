This is an e-commerce app made using a json file to store the data, node js for the backend and next js/react/typerscript for the frontend.

The app is currently one page but it has lots of functionality
It shows the products
It allows the user to add an remove from a basket
It shows the number of items in a basket
It shows the total cost of the basket

Future plans are to create a checkout page, add admin functionality and implement search functionality
